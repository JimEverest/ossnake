### Test Files:

Each file will contain tests for a specific feature and provider. For example, tests/aliyun/test\_basic\_upload.py will contain tests for basic upload functionality for Aliyun OSS.

### Test Cases:

Each test case will cover a specific aspect of the feature, including:

*   Positive Cases: Test the feature with valid inputs and expected behavior.

*   Negative Cases: Test the feature with invalid inputs and expected error handling.

*   Edge Cases: Test the feature with boundary conditions and unusual inputs.

*   Performance Cases: Test the performance of the feature under various loads (may be combined with concurrency tests).

The same structure and test cases should be applied to the `tests/aws/` and `tests/minio/` directories, with adjustments for provider-specific features and behaviors.

**General Notes:**

*   **Test Data:** Use `os.urandom` to generate random test data for files.
*   **Configuration:** Load configurations from `config.json` and use environment variables for sensitive information.
*   **Logging:** Use the logging module with detailed and colored output.
*   **Error Handling:** Catch all expected exceptions and log them with detailed information.
*   **Resource Management:** Ensure that all resources (e.g., temporary files, remote objects) are properly cleaned up after each test.
*   **Test Isolation:** Each test method should be independent and not rely on the state of other tests.
*   **Test Reporting:** Use the custom test runner and result classes to generate structured test reports.
*   **Provider-Specifics:** Be aware of provider-specific behaviors and adjust tests accordingly.
*   **Mocking:** Use mocking for testing error handling and transfer management features.

This detailed plan should provide a clear roadmap for implementing the tests. Remember to follow the established testing style and principles, and to document any provider-specific behaviors or issues.
